# cQualizer

This hobby project, and the intention is a **Software** which **Visualizes Sound**.
My goal isn't to create the perfect tool. Of course it would be nice to have as much features as possible but that's not what I'm aiming for.
I created this project for trying out new stuff with an actual project (this includes **OpenGL**, **WPFs**in **C#** and maybe even **Machine Learing**)

# Feature List

These are the **Features** which would be cool to have.
Not all might get implemented because thinking of an idea is much more simpler than actually doing it.

[ ] Modern looking Sound Visualizer
[ ] Ability to change color to the beat
[ ] A Gradient effect on the color to make it more modern looking

More features might be added in the future and some might be removed.
Nothing is final.
